# Markov Chain Text Generator

This is a simple algorithm implementing a markov chain.

```
  ruby markov.rb 'lyrics.txt'
```

Produces something like:

```
Meet me at the back of your car to the back of your car I never 
And so I drank one It became four And when you go Oh oh, oh... 
Take me anywhere, I don't want to believe You are your Mother's 
only son and heir of nothing in particular You shut your mouth 
As you savour the flavour Of MURDER NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, IT'S 
MURDER Who hears when animals cry? Farewell to this land's 
cheerless marches Hemmed in like a butterfly ...
```
